# Forced Alignment Pipeline
Implementation of a forced alignment pipeline for speech-to-text alignment using Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) and Neural Alignment (Wav2Vec2) fallbacks. Includes environment setup, OOV word handling, and TextGrid generation for the IIITH Speech & AIML assignment.

## Repository Contents
* `Forced_Alignment_Pipeline.ipynb`: Complete execution log. Contains the MFA setup code (Task 1-4) and the Neural Alignment fallback (Task 5).
* `TextGrid_Outputs/`: The final aligned files.
* `Report.pdf`: Analysis of the alignment and OOV handling.

## How to Run
Open `Forced_Alignment_Pipeline.ipynb` in Google Colab to replicate the experiment.
